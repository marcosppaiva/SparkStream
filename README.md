# SparkStream

## Simulating TCP / IP data flow

If you have already built Spark, you can run this example as follows. You will first need to run Netcat (a small utility found in most Unix-like systems) 

```
$ nc -lk 9797
```

If you use a windows environment, I suggest you use mobaxterm.
download [Mobaxterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

After download and unzip open Mobaxterm and use the command

```
$ nc -lk 9797
```

Port 9797 is now open and ready to send messages

Now run the notebook and send messages
